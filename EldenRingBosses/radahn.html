            <h2>Summary</h2>
            
            <p>Starscourge Radahn is one of the demigod bosses that all players must defeat. He is a colossal figure, heavily armored, and wields two massive greatswords. Radahn is associated with the Starscourge, a mysterious and corrupting force that has ravaged the lands between. Throughout the game, Radahn is portrayed as a formidable adversary, embodying the power of the Starscourge. Players encounter him in a grand arena, where they engage in a challenging battle that requires skill, strategy, and reliance on ones allies to overcome.</p>

            <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
            
            <p>Radahn is susceptible to fire damage. Weapons infused with fire, fire-based spells, or items that apply fire buffs can deal significant damage to him. Exploiting this weakness can help players defeat him more efficiently. Radahn is also vulnerable to lightning damage. Lightning-infused weapons or lightning-based spells can be effective against him, especially if players have invested in stats or abilities that enhance lightning damage. While Radahn is a formidable opponent, he can still be damaged by physical attacks.</p>

            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            
            <p>Players with high-strength builds or powerful physical weapons can chip away at his health by landing well-timed strikes. Certain status effects, such as bleed or poison, can also be effective against Radahn. Inflicting these effects on him through weapons, spells, or consumables can gradually wear down his health over time, making the battle more manageable. Radahn's size and slower movement speed can be exploited by agile players. Dodging his attacks and maintaining distance can help players avoid damage and create opportunities for counterattacks.</p>
