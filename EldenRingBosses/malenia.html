            <h2>Summary</h2>
            
            <p>Malenia, Blade of Miquella is known as the hardest boss in Elden Ring and one of the most difficult bosses in video games. At the beginning of your fight with her she speaks to you, "I dreamt for so long. My flesh was dull gold...and my blood, rotted. Corpse after corpse, left in my wake. As I awaited...his return. Heed my words. I am Malenia. Blade of Miquella. And I have never known defeat."</p>

            <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
            
            <p>Malenia has low Poise, which means it doesn't take much to break her stance. Also, she is vulnerable to knockdown attacks in her first phase, so using a weapon that can inflict this is essential. She is also weak to frost damage and the bleed status effect. Frost can even stun her during her Waterwolf Dance attack.</p>

        <div class="col-content">
        
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            
            <p>By abusing the fact that the inflicting frostbite takes 7% of her total health, you can dual wield frost and fire weapons. If you inflict frost, you can remove it with a fire-based attack. Inflict frost again to take another 7% of her total health. Repeat this process. Take note, she can heal herself through the damage she inflicts on you and your teammates. Because of this, it is best to fight her alone or with very competent teammates.</p>
