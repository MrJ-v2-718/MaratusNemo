            <h2>Summary</h2>
            
            <p>Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy is a Demigod and a two phase boss in Elden Ring. He offered himself up to the serpent and in return is granted eternal life. After his followers learned of this, most sought his death, which you have been tasked with providing. Although this boss is an optional one, he is a shardbearer and two will need to be defeated before you will be granted entrance into the Royal Capital of Leyndell.</p>

            <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
            
            <p>Rykards weakness is his predictable attacks. Watch out for Snake Bite: The Serpent lunges from one side towards you. It will sometimes follow up with a second lunge from the opposite direction. Dodge towards the direction the lunge is coming from. Grab Attack: The Serpent raises its head up high and lunges forward. If the attack connects, the snake will grab the player, slamming them twice but dealing damage only once. Requires precise timing to prevent the grab.</p>

            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            
            <p>The Serpent-Hunter great spear is essential to defeating Rykard. It can be found on a corpse when you first enter the boss arena. Take note, Rykard may be powerful, but he has predictable attack patterns. Use your agility and mobility to dodge his attacks effectively, allowing you to avoid damage and position yourself for counterattacks. Learning his moveset and knowing when to dodge can be crucial for surviving the battle.</p>
