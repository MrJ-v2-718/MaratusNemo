        VS Code was used to create this Webpage.

        When planning a website you must first determine
        the purpose of the site as well as the audience.
        You should also take into consideration variances
        in screen size and shape as well as different
        browser types. The structure of the site should
        be decided as well, but webbed structures tend
        to be the most common. Alternatives are linear
        and hierarchical (ordered and directory based).
        This is also where you decide which graphics to use,
        the font and size, color, and any search bars. Last
        but not least, you should design your website to be
        accessible to everyone, this means accomodating
        for any type of visual or hearing impairments.

        Chapter 1 taught me how to plan for the design of
        a website, the basics of the internet and browsers,
        some standard protocols used on said internet,
        internet vs. extranet vs. intranet, as well as 
        HTML basics and implementation.
