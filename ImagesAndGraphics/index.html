            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>It is of paramount importance to use appropriate and descriptive file names for images so that other developers can understand your code. Also, if you
            spend some time away from your work and come back to it at a later date, it will still make sense. In addition, you will understand what the images are 
            doing even before viewing them in a browser.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The application I used to change the size of the image is Adobe Express.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image in pixels was 2121 x 1414.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html15.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>The online image compressor I used was compressor.io. The original file size was 38 KB and compressed image size is just 7KB.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html15_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>I noticed no discenrnable difference between the original picture before compression and the final picture after compression.</p>

                <h3>SVG Graphics</h3>
                
                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->

                <svg width="300" height="200">
                        <polygon points="100,10 40,198 190,78 10,78 160,198"
                        style="fill:teal;stroke:whitesmoke;stroke-width:3;fill-rule:evenodd;" />
                </svg>
               
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>To create my SVG graphic I went to https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_svg.asp and went through their tutorial on how to create one. 
                I decided on a star with a line thickness of 3 and chose the color teal to complement the teal HTML 5 picture on the page.</p>
