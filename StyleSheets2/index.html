                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p>Color Converter Used: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Color_picker_tool" class="external" target="_blank">Mozilla Color Picker</a></p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>Colors used on the internet are called web colors and can be represented 
                in different ways; as RGB decimal values, in hexadecimal format, or by it's HSL values. 
                RBG stands for red, blue, and green. To create a color using this model, the 
                three colors are added together to create the desired color. Hexadecimal format also 
                uses red, blue, and green, however, the values are represented in hexadecimal format. 
                The last is HSL which stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is chosen from a color 
                wheel and each degree of the circle corresponds to a particular color. Saturation is the how 
                intense the color is and is represented as a percentage. Lastly, lightness is a measure of how 
                much light is in the color represented as a percentage.</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: Hexadecimal</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>The HWB color model stands for hue, whiteness, and blackness and is similar to the HSL 
                color model. It is designed to be intuitive to use and faster to process. Hue is the same 
                as it is in HSV and corresponds to the degree on the color wheel. Whiteness and blackness 
                is represented as a percentage.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>The CMYK color model stands for cyan, magenta, yellow, and key and is most commonly 
                used in printing. The four colors are mixed on a white background, so the default color 
                is white. The colors added alter how much light is reflected from the white paper, making 
                this color model a subtractive one.</p>
